# mamaearth-clone
Mamaearth is an ecommerce site for purchasing natural products like facewash, hair oils, soap etc. In this website user can see all the products and whichever products he wants he can add it to the cart and then proceed to the checkout page and can place the order by entering card details in the payment page. We have also added the discount feature where a user can put Masai30 as a coupon code and can get 30% discount.
